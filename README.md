# Brainiac-Discord-Bot
Brainiac Bot ! Developed in Python.

The Brainiac Discord Bot is a tool to help students and researchers without ever leaving their servers. As Discord continues to grow in popularity, especially among students working on group projects, new functionalities are needed that suit this need.

Brainiac allows you to pull Wikipedia articles and learn definitions of terms that are sent right into the channel. This means you won't have to open a new browser/tab when you want to search something up, and can instead have Brainiac retrieve a link for you.

As this is a WIP, the next features I plan to implement are:

A Scholarly Article finder
Allowing users to input a specified number of links they want to retrieve for better research purposes
To use this bot in your own servers, simply create a new bot (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW8c7vT6Hl4) on the Discord Developer page, and copy/paste the bot token in the final run command.
